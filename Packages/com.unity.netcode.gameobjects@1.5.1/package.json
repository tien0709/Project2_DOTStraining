    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added support for serializing `NativeArray<>` and `NativeList<>` in `FastBufferReader`/`FastBufferWriter`, `BufferSerializer`, `NetworkVariable`, and RPCs. (To use `NativeList<>`, add `UNITY_NETCODE_NATIVE_COLLECTION_SUPPORT` to your Scripting Define Symbols in `Project Settings > Player`) (#2375)\n- The location of the automatically-created default network prefab list can now be configured (#2544)\n- Added: Message size limits (max single message and max fragmented message) can now be set using NetworkManager.MaximumTransmissionUnitSize and NetworkManager.MaximumFragmentedMessageSize for transports that don't work with the default values (#2530)\n- Added `NetworkObject.SpawnWithObservers` property (default is true) that when set to false will spawn a `NetworkObject` with no observers and will not be spawned on any client until `NetworkObject.NetworkShow` is invoked. (#2568)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed: Fixed a null reference in codegen in some projects (#2581)\n- Fixed issue where the `OnClientDisconnected` client identifier was incorrect after a pending client connection was denied. (#2569)\n- Fixed warning \"Runtime Network Prefabs was not empty at initialization time.\" being erroneously logged when no runtime network prefabs had been added (#2565)\n- Fixed issue where some temporary debug console logging was left in a merged PR. (#2562)\n- Fixed the \"Generate Default Network Prefabs List\" setting not loading correctly and always reverting to being checked. (#2545)\n- Fixed issue where users could not use NetworkSceneManager.VerifySceneBeforeLoading to exclude runtime generated scenes from client synchronization. (#2550)\n- Fixed missing value on `NetworkListEvent` for `EventType.RemoveAt` events.  (#2542,#2543)\n- Fixed issue where parenting a NetworkTransform under a transform with a scale other than Vector3.one would result in incorrect values on non-authoritative instances. (#2538)\n- Fixed issue where a server would include scene migrated and then despawned NetworkObjects to a client that was being synchronized. (#2532)\n- Fixed the inspector throwing exceptions when attempting to render `NetworkVariable`s of enum types. (#2529)\n- Making a `NetworkVariable` with an `INetworkSerializable` type that doesn't meet the `new()` constraint will now create a compile-time error instead of an editor crash (#2528)\n- Fixed Multiplayer Tools package installation docs page link on the NetworkManager popup. (#2526)\n- Fixed an exception and error logging when two different objects are shown and hidden on the same frame (#2524)\n- Fixed a memory leak in `UnityTransport` that occurred if `StartClient` failed. (#2518)\n- Fixed issue where a client could throw an exception if abruptly disconnected from a network session with one or more spawned `NetworkObject`(s). (#2510)\n- Fixed issue where invalid endpoint addresses were not being detected and returning false from NGO UnityTransport. (#2496)\n- Fixed some errors that could occur if a connection is lost and the loss is detected when attempting to write to the socket. (#2495)\n\n## Changed\n\n- Adding network prefabs before NetworkManager initialization is now supported. (#2565)\n- Connecting clients being synchronized now switch to the server's active scene before spawning and synchronizing NetworkObjects. (#2532)\n- Updated `UnityTransport` dependency on `com.unity.transport` to 1.3.4. (#2533)\n- Improved performance of NetworkBehaviour initialization by replacing reflection when initializing NetworkVariables with compile-time code generation, which should help reduce hitching during additive scene loads. (#2522)"
